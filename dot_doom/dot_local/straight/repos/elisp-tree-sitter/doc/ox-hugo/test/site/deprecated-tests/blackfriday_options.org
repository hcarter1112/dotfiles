* Deprecation note <2022-01-15 Sat>
These tests were for setting different Blackfriday options using the
~HUGO_BLACKFRIDAY~ keyword/property.

Hugo has switched from using Blackfriday to Goldmark as the Markdown
parser since v0.60.0 (which is quite a few years at the time of
writing this).

The ~HUGO_BLACKFRIDAY~ values have now stopped exporting to the
front-matter if ~org-hugo-goldmark~ is non-nil.

*** Blackfriday fractions false
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: blackfriday-fractions-false
:EXPORT_DATE: 2017-08-02
:EXPORT_HUGO_BLACKFRIDAY: :fractions nil
:END:
A Blackfriday option can be disabled by setting the option value to
/nothing/, =nil= or =false=.

These will not be rendered as fractions:
#+include: "./all-posts.org::#fraction-table" :only-contents t

But these will always be rendered as fractions, even when the
Blackfriday =fractions= option is set to =false= like in this post.
- 1/2, 1/4, 3/4
*** Blackfriday fractions true
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: blackfriday-fractions-true
:EXPORT_DATE: 2017-08-02
:EXPORT_HUGO_BLACKFRIDAY: :fractions t
:END:
A Blackfriday option can be enabled by setting the option value to
=t= or =true=.

All of these will be rendered as fractions:
#+include: "./all-posts.org::#fraction-table" :only-contents t

Below are special as they will *always* be rendered as fractions, even
when the Blackfriday =fractions= option is set to =false= (though this
post has that option set to =true= -- which is also the default value).
- 1/2, 1/4, 3/4
** Extensions
*** Hard line break wrong case (TOML)                                  :toml:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: blackfriday-ext-hardlinebreak-wrong-case-toml
:EXPORT_DATE: 2017-08-02
:EXPORT_HUGO_BLACKFRIDAY: :extensions hardlinebreak
:END:
The Blackfriday =hardLineBreak= extension is enabled here even where
user used the wrong case in the extension name:
#+begin_example
:EXPORT_HUGO_BLACKFRIDAY: :extensions hardlinebreak
#+end_example
instead of:
#+begin_example
:EXPORT_HUGO_BLACKFRIDAY: :extensions hardLineBreak
#+end_example

The Blackfriday extension names are case-sensitive. So even though,
the wrong case is used in the Org property drawer, =ox-hugo= ensures
that the Markdown front matter is written in the correct case!
