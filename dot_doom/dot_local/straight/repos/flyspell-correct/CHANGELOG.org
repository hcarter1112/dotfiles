- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/52][#52]] Add highlighting of the word being currently corrected.
- Support Emacs customization interface - =customize=.
- Align point movement between =flyspell-correct-at= and
  =flyspell-correct-move=, so there is no difference in resulting point location
  when any of these functions is called with point at misspelled word.
- Rewrite all tests using [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][buttercup]] library.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/66][#66]], [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/68][#68]] Allow to correct and save the word in one pass.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/73][#73]] New action - =stop= allowing to leave the point at the misspelled word.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/58][#58]] =skip= action now allows to correct 'next' word even if rapid mode is not
  enabled.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/58][#58]], [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/72][#72]] Allow to hook into =flyspell-correct-ivy= interface via
  =flyspell-correct-ivy-map=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/pull/78][#78]] Add actions to =flyspell-correct-dummy= interface.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/pull/79][#79]] Disable sorting in =flyspell-correct-dummy=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/pull/84][#84]] Polish mark setting behaviour.
  - Make it consistent between =flyspell-correct-wrapper=,
    =flyspell-correct-previous=, =flyspell-correct-next=.
  - Make it more conservative and push the mark only on correction. E.g. =skip=,
    =break= and =stop= do not modify mark.
  - Push the original position when using =stop= to be able to quickly return
    there.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/pull/92][#92]] Polish =flyspell-correct-completing-read= interface.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/pull/94][#94]] Implement avy-like quick keys for
  =flyspell-correct-completing-read= interface.

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/60][#60]] Fix non-breaking rapid mode with helm interface.
- Fix exception when trying to remove missing =flyspell-correct-overlay=
  (happens when buffer has no words to correct).
- Fix exception when dealing with missing marks.
- Fix word at point not being prioritised by =flyspell-correct-move=,
  =flyspell-correct-next=, =flyspell-correct-previous= and
  =flyspell-correct-wrapper= by explicitly sort overlays so misspelled word at
  point is always at the beginning of the list.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/83][#83]] Fix invalid handing of empty candidates list in =flyspell-correct-ivy=.

** v0.6.1

- Remove deprecated aliases (=flyspell-correct-word-generic=,
  =flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic= and
  =flyspell-correct-next-word-generic=).

** v0.6
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

- Do not move point by correction functions.
- New interface - =avy-menu=. Thanks to @clemera.
- Mark custom interfaces as autoload.
- Add =use-package= examples.
- Fix errors in transient mode. Thanks to @Ergus
- Fix many warnings.

** v0.5

- Skip words that don't need to be fixed (e.g. duplicates).
- Rename several functions (via name deprecation)
  - =flyspell-correct-next-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-next=
  - =flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-previous=
  - =flyspell-correct-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-at-point=
- Create a wrapper function for most of the cases, namely
  =flyspell-correct-wrapper=.
- Implement a 'rapid mode' for =flyspell-correct-wrapper=, allowing user to fix
  multiple words in one run (=skip= action can be used to skip current incorrect
  word and continue to the next one).
- Add some simple tests to cover the most important use cases.
- Fix issue when =flyspell-correct-next= doesn't correct word at point.

** v0.4
