################ These are the steps to follow for the install script

0 - Move your dnf.conf file into place to speed things up
sudo mv /etc/dnf/dnf.conf /etc/dnf/dnf.conf.bak && cp /home/ralldi/Downloads/dnf.conf /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

1 - Update system
2 - in a separate terminal start the nerdfonts download and the rclone sync

## Copy over nerdfonts and backgrounds
cp -r /home/ralldi/Downloads/nerd-fonts/ /home/ralldi/.gitstuff

## git clone nerd fonts (if not present on your local drive)
git clone https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts.git

## Chezmoi install and init
sudo su &&
cd / &&
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" &&
exit

3 - Download Zhumu from 
https://www.me.zhumu.com/download

4 - Run init_1 AS SUDO!!! - This installs all of your package manager programs along 
with creating necessary folders if you don't have them. It also chages your 
hostname. You can change this by going to the file and changing the last line
before running the script.This script also syncs with RPM and installs flatpak. It also installs media codecs

## Chezmoi apply - pull files from github and insert them
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/hcarter1112/dotfiles &&

## Rclone sync
/home/ralldi/.config/scripts/rclone-gd-init.sh

## Install Node Version Manager (nvm)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
  nvm install node

## Install rust and cargo
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

## Install Lunar Vim
LV_BRANCH='release-1.2/neovim-0.8' bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunarvim/lunarvim/master/utils/installer/install.sh)

5 -  Run init_2 without root - REFRESH BASH BEFORE RUNNING!!! - This script takes care of downloading a bunch of 
gitfiles and getting them set up for init_3. This also installs your pip and 
flatpack packages

6 - Run init_3 AS SUDO!!! -  This script is just to place files in root and wrap up 
some of the git installs
