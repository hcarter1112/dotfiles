################ These are the steps to follow for the install script

1 - Update system
2 - in a separate terminal start the nerdfonts download and the rclone sync

## git clone nerd fonts
git clone https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts.git

## Chezmoi install and init
sudo su  
cd / &&
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" &&
exit

## Chezmoi apply - pull files from github and insert them
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/hcarter1112/dotfiles &&

## Rclone sync
/home/ralldi/.config/scripts/rclone-gd-init.sh

3 - Download Zhumu from 
https://www.me.zhumu.com/download

4 - Run init_1 AS SUDO!!! - This installs all of your package manager programs along 
with creating necessary folders if you don't have them. It also chages your 
hostname. You can change this by going to the file and changing the last line
before running the script.

This script also syncs with RPM and installs flatpak. It also installs media codecs

5 -  Run init_2 without root - This script takes care of downloading a bunch of 
gitfiles and getting them set up for init_3. This also installs your pip and 
flatpack packages

6 - Run init_3 AS SUDO!!! -  This script is just to place files in root and wrap up 
some of the git installs
